# ML_Spinal_deformation_Class_Prediction
This project is about predicting the spinal deformation classes using the biomechanics of a patient.

• CONTEXT: Medical research university X is undergoing a deep research on patients with certain conditions (Spinal Deformation). Due to confidentiality the patient’s details and the conditions are masked by providing different datasets for developing a AIML model which can predict the condition of the patient depending on the received test results.

• DATA DESCRIPTION: The data consists of biomechanics features of the patients according to their current conditions. Each patient is represented in the data set by six biomechanics attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the condition to their body part.

P_incidence
P_tilt
L_angle
S_slope
P_radius
S_degree
Class

# Project Objective:
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to:

* Clean and preprocess the dataset.
* Utilize the dataset to train supervised learning algorithms.
* Build a model that can predict patient conditions based on the provided biomechanic attributes.

# Note: Please view the code in colab for better view.
